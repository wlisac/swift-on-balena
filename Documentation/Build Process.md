# Build Process

The build / test / release process is currently pretty manual and not usable by potential contributors. This is an area of opportunity, to say the least. ðŸ˜…

Below is an example process to add Swift 5.0.1 for aarch64 devices:

- Create new 5.0.1 folders in `Dockerfiles/architecture-base/aarch64/{osName}/{osVersion}` for each OS variant
- Add build and run folders
- Add Dockerfiles (typically these are based on previous Dockerfiles or from the official swift-docker repo)
- Update Dockerfile comment (`# wlisac/aarch64-ubuntu-swift:5.0.1-xenial-build`) and tarball URL
- Run `swift run Run build --swiftVersion 5.0.1` to build the architecture base images
- Run `swift run Run test --swiftVersion 5.0.1` to test the architecture base images
- Run `swift run Run generate --swiftVersion 5.0.1` to generate the device base image Dockerfiles
- Run `swift run Run build --swiftVersion 5.0.1` to build all of the new images
- If you want to test the new device images, you can run `swift run Run test --swiftVersion 5.0.1` again
- Once all of the images are built and tested, time to push: `swift run Run push --swiftVersion 5.0.1`
- Run `swift run Run tag-default-images --swiftVersion 5.0.1 --buildVariant build` to tag (build) default images (images without an OS specified)
- Run `swift run Run tag-default-images --swiftVersion 5.0.1 --buildVariant run` to tag (run) default images (images without an OS specified)
- Run `swift run Run push-default-images --swiftVersion 5.0.1 --buildVariant build` to push these (build) default images
- Run `swift run Run push-default-images --swiftVersion 5.0.1 --buildVariant run` to push these (run) default images
- Note that the tag / push default images requires manually specifying build / run variants. We should fix that.
- Commit these Dockerfiles and update readme with latest release info

Sometimes the build or test scripts will hang. If docker appears idle, try to stop and re-run the script.
